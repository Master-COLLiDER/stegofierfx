## StegofierFX:
*The growth of high-speed computer network, and internet in particular has increased the ease of communication, and the use of digital formatted data. Compared to Analog media, digital media offers many different advantages such as high quality, easy editing, high reliability copy, compression, time to send it from sender to recipient etc. Therefore, Data and Information Security becomes an integral part of Data Communication. But these type of advancements in the field of data communication has increased the fear of getting data stolen at the time of transferring. In order to address this issue, numerous method of protecting that data have been evolved and one of method is steganography. Steganography plays an important role in the field of Data and information Security. Steganography is the science of embedding secret messages in such a way that no one, except the intended sender and receiver suspects that there is a secret message. It is the art of hiding the fact that a communication is taking place in plain sight. This Project is intended to develop a software application for Digital Image Steganography. Digital Image Steganography is a type of image steganography used to hide data and information inside digital images (specifically for Portable network Graphics (PNG) image format). This project makes use of The Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion method. This method is the most common and easiest method for embedding messages in an image with high capacity. The embedding message can only be retrieved using proper techniques. For more secure approach, it also uses Cryptography techniques of both Synchronous and Asynchronous types.*

***Stegofier** is an Application Software, with simple and user friendly interface to hide and retrieve message inside any Image file (Specifically for Portable Network Graphics (.PNG) files) with a support for range of Devices and Operating Systems.*
